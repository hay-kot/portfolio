<p><a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> is best described by the project themselves</p><blockquote>Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts. Perfect to run on a Raspberry Pi or a local server.</blockquote><p>As an avid self-hosting and chronic time waster, Hoem Assistant is a gold mine of little projects here an there that balloon into a massive and critical part of my home. I dread the day the batteries run out on my motion sensors and I have to <strong>manually</strong> turn the lights on. As such a critical part of my home infrastructure, I've come to have a thought nearly anytime I do a project. How does this integrate into Home Assistant? Â </p><p>For Christmas my lovely wife was nice enough to get me a subscription to a VPS so I could host a blog and run a few other things in the cloud. As the paranoid self-hoster I am, I wanted to get notifications for SSH Logins and loop those into Home Assistant for extra convenience. Solving this problem was WAY easier than I imagined. With a short script and a little data formatting, I was able to create a <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/logbook/">Logbook Card</a> on my dashboard that showed recent activity. </p><h2 id="in-home-assistant-node-red">In Home Assistant - Node-Red</h2><p>We'll be using a webhook to receive data from the server on Home Assistant. To do this, there are two options. Using Node-Red, or using yaml. A long time ago I decided to shift all my automation from yaml to Node-Red so that is the path I recommend and will go over here. However you can accomplish the same using yaml with a combination of webhooks and Data Templating.</p><p> With Node-Red you'll need to create a webhook node and generate a random URL (save this for later). Connect that to a JSON block to process the posted data into a JavaScript object and optionally pass that through a Change Node to set the Topic, and a Delay Node to limit the messages. Finally you need to map the actually value to an Entity Node. We'll be using the payload.message object to hold the entity sensor value. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.hay-kot.dev/content/images/2021/01/flow-Example-1.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="https://blog.hay-kot.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/flow-Example-1.png 600w, https://blog.hay-kot.dev/content/images/2021/01/flow-Example-1.png 885w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Flow Example</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.hay-kot.dev/content/images/2021/01/ssh_entity_node_config.png" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>Entity Payload</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code>[{"id":"ac17221d.ca7b4","type":"ha-webhook","z":"bee214af.688e28","name":"SSH Notification Webhook","server":"15e97f32.f16891","outputs":1,"webhookId":"MY-SSH-WEBHOOK","payloadLocation":"payload","payloadLocationType":"msg","headersLocation":"","headersLocationType":"none","x":130,"y":400,"wires":[["6812e653.224d68"]]},{"id":"38588fad.38fd88","type":"ha-entity","z":"bee214af.688e28","name":"SSH Entity","server":"15e97f32.f16891","version":1,"debugenabled":false,"outputs":1,"entityType":"sensor","config":[{"property":"name","value":"SSH Login"},{"property":"device_class","value":""},{"property":"icon","value":""},{"property":"unit_of_measurement","value":""}],"state":"payload.message","stateType":"msg","attributes":[],"resend":true,"outputLocation":"","outputLocationType":"none","inputOverride":"allow","x":750,"y":400,"wires":[[]]},{"id":"78b836a5.441e78","type":"delay","z":"bee214af.688e28","name":"","pauseType":"rate","timeout":"5","timeoutUnits":"seconds","rate":"1","nbRateUnits":"1","rateUnits":"minute","randomFirst":"1","randomLast":"5","randomUnits":"seconds","drop":true,"x":530,"y":400,"wires":[["38588fad.38fd88"]]},{"id":"6812e653.224d68","type":"json","z":"bee214af.688e28","name":"","property":"payload","action":"obj","pretty":false,"x":290,"y":400,"wires":[["78b836a5.441e78","b22a904e.f459"]]},{"id":"b22a904e.f459","type":"change","z":"bee214af.688e28","name":"Set Topic","rules":[{"t":"move","p":"payload.topic","pt":"msg","to":"topic","tot":"msg"}],"action":"","property":"","from":"","to":"","reg":false,"x":400,"y":400,"wires":[["78b836a5.441e78"]]},{"id":"15e97f32.f16891","type":"server","name":"Home Assistant"}]</code></pre><figcaption>Code Sample</figcaption></figure><h2 id="on-the-server">On The Server</h2><p>On the server you'd like to recieve notifications for you need to create/edit <code>/etc/ssh/sshrc</code> This file can be used to execute scripts on ssh login and is a built in functionality.
