My day job as a building automation engineer I find many opportunities to use python to automate the mundane everyday tasks. While the company I work for excels in the industry at leading the pact I find their internal tooling to be less than verbose at times. Like many companies a strong focus is put on the outward facing product to provide a rich user-experience for customers. As I've come to learn more and more about python I've worked to build several applications that I've used to save many hours over the last few months. As time went on I developed a self contained web based application that could be distributed to others to share in the efficiencies I had created.
